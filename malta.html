      <h1>Malta</h1>

      <p>
        Malta (/ˈmɔːltə/ (About this soundlisten) MAWL-tə, UK also /ˈmɒltə/
        MOL-tə,[13] Maltese: [ˈmɐltɐ]), officially known as the Republic of
        Malta (Maltese: Repubblika ta' Malta [rɛˈpʊbːlɪkɐ tɐ ˈmɐltɐ]) and
        formerly Melita, is a Southern European island country consisting of an
        archipelago in the Mediterranean Sea.[14] It lies 80 km (50 mi) south of
        Italy, 284 km (176 mi) east of Tunisia,[15] and 333 km (207 mi) north of
        Libya.[16] With a population of about 515,000[5] over an area of 316 km2
        (122 sq mi),[4] Malta is the world's tenth smallest country in
        area[17][18] and fourth most densely populated sovereign country. Its
        capital is Valletta, which is the smallest national capital in the
        European Union by area at 0.61 km2 (0.24 sq mi). The official and
        national language is Maltese, which is descended from Sicilian Arabic
        that developed during the Emirate of Sicily, while English serves as the
        second official language. Italian and Sicilian also previously served as
        official and cultural languages on the island for centuries, with
        Italian being an official language in Malta until 1934 and a majority of
        the current Maltese population being at least conversational in the
        Italian language.

        Malta has been inhabited since approximately 5900 BC.[19] Its location
        in the centre of the Mediterranean[20] has historically given it great
        strategic importance as a naval base, with a succession of powers having
        contested and ruled the islands, including the Phoenicians and
        Carthaginians, Romans, Greeks, Arabs, Normans, Aragonese, Knights of St.
        John, French, and British, amongst others.[21] Most of these foreign
        influences have left some sort of mark on the country's ancient culture.

        Malta became a British colony in 1813, serving as a way station for
        ships and the headquarters for the British Mediterranean Fleet. It was
        besieged by the Axis powers during World War II and was an important
        Allied base for operations in North Africa and the
        Mediterranean.[22][23] The British parliament passed the Malta
        Independence Act in 1964, giving Malta independence from the United
        Kingdom as the State of Malta, with Elizabeth II as its queen.[24] The
        country became a republic in 1974. It has been a member state of the
        Commonwealth of Nations and the United Nations since independence, and
        joined the European Union in 2004; it became part of the eurozone
        monetary union in 2008..

        Malta has had Christians since the time of Early Christianity, though
        was predominantly Muslim while under Arab rule, at which time Christians
        were tolerated. Muslim rule ended with the Norman invasion of Malta by
        Roger I in 1091. Today, Catholicism is the state religion, but the
        Constitution of Malta guarantees freedom of conscience and religious
        worship

        Malta is a tourist destination with its warm climate, numerous
        recreational areas, and architectural and historical monuments,
        including three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Ħal Saflieni Hypogeum,[27]
        Valletta,[28] and seven megalithic temples which are some of the oldest
        free-standing structures in the world.
