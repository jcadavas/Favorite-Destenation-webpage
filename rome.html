      <h1>Rome</h1>

      <p>
        Rome (Italian and Latin: Roma [ˈroːma] (About this soundlisten)) is the
        capital city of Italy. It is also the capital of the Lazio region, the
        centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome, and a special comune named
        Comune di Roma Capitale. With 2,860,009 residents in 1,285 km2 (496.1 sq
        mi),[1] Rome is the country's most populated comune and the third most
        populous city in the European Union by population within city limits.
        The Metropolitan City of Rome, with a population of 4,355,725 residents,
        is the most populous metropolitan city in Italy.[2] Its metropolitan
        area is the third-most populous within Italy.[3] Rome is located in the
        central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium),
        along the shores of the Tiber. Vatican City (the smallest country in the
        world)[4] is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome,
        the only existing example of a country within a city; for this reason,
        Rome has sometimes been described as the capital of two states.[5][6]
        Rome is often referred to as the City of Seven Hills due to its
        geographic location and also the "Eternal City"
      </p>

        Rome's history spans 28 centuries. While Roman mythology dates the
        founding of Rome at around 753 BC, the site has been inhabited for much
        longer, making it a major human settlement for almost three millennia
        and one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe.[8] The
        city's early population originated from a mix of Latins, Etruscans, and
        Sabines. Eventually, the city successively became the capital of the
        Roman Kingdom, the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, and is regarded
        by many as the first-ever Imperial city and metropolis.[9] It was first
        called The Eternal City (Latin: Urbs Aeterna; Italian: La Città Eterna)
        by the Roman poet Tibullus in the 1st century BC, and the expression was
        also taken up by Ovid, Virgil, and Livy.[10][11] Rome is also called
        "Caput Mundi" (Capital of the World). After the fall of the Empire in
        the west, which marked the beginning of the Middle Ages, Rome slowly
        fell under the political control of the Papacy, and in the 8th century,
        it became the capital of the Papal States, which lasted until 1870.
        Beginning with the Renaissance, almost all popes since Nicholas V
        (1447–1455) pursued a coherent architectural and urban programme over
        four hundred years, aimed at making the city the artistic and cultural
        centre of the world.[12] In this way, Rome became first one of the major
        centres of the Renaissance,[13] and then the birthplace of both the
        Baroque style and Neoclassicism. Famous artists, painters, sculptors and
        architects made Rome the centre of their activity, creating masterpieces
        throughout the city. In 1871, Rome became the capital of the Kingdom of
        Italy, which, in 1946, became the Italian Republic.

        In 2019, Rome was the 11th most visited city in the world with 10.1
        million tourists, the third most visited in the European Union, and the
        most popular tourist destination in Italy.[14] Its historic centre is
        listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.[15] The host city for the
        1960 Summer Olympics, Rome is also the seat of several specialised
        agencies of the United Nations, such as the Food and Agriculture
        Organization (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the International
        Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). The city also hosts the
        Secretariat of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union for the
        Mediterranean[16] (UfM) as well as the headquarters of many
        international business companies such as Eni, Enel, TIM, Leonardo
        S.p.A., and national and international banks such as Unicredit and BNL.
        Rome's EUR business district is the home of many companies involved in
        the oil industry, the pharmaceutical industry, and financial services.
        The presence of renowned international brands in the city has made Rome
        an important centre of fashion and design, and the Cinecittà Studios
        have been the set of many Academy Award–winning movies.
