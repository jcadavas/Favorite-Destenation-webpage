      <h1>Switzerland</h1>

      <p>
        Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a landlocked country
        situated at the confluence of Western, Central and Southern Europe.[note
        4][14] It is a federal republic composed of 26 cantons, with federal
        authorities based in Bern.[note 1][2][1] Switzerland is bordered by
        Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north and Austria
        and Liechtenstein to the east. It is geographically divided among the
        Swiss Plateau, the Alps and the Jura, spanning a total area of 41,285
        km2 (15,940 sq mi) and land area of 39,997 km2 (15,443 sq mi). Although
        the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population
        of approximately 8.5 million is concentrated mostly on the plateau,
        where the largest cities and economic centres are located, among them
        Zürich, Geneva and Basel. These cities are home to several offices of
        international organisations such as the WTO, the WHO, the ILO, the
        headquarters of FIFA, the UN's second-largest office, as well as the
        main building of the Bank for International Settlements. The main
        international airports of Switzerland are also located in these cities.
      </p>

        The establishment of the Old Swiss Confederacy dates to the late
        medieval period, resulting from a series of military successes against
        Austria and Burgundy. Swiss independence from the Holy Roman Empire was
        formally recognised in the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. The Federal
        Charter of 1291 is considered the founding document of Switzerland which
        is celebrated on Swiss National Day. Since the Reformation of the 16th
        century, Switzerland has maintained a strong policy of armed neutrality;
        it has not fought an international war since 1815 and did not join the
        United Nations until 2002. Nevertheless, it pursues an active foreign
        policy and is frequently involved in peace-building processes around the
        world.[15] Switzerland is the birthplace of the Red Cross, one of the
        world's oldest and best known humanitarian organisations. It is a
        founding member of the European Free Trade Association, but notably not
        part of the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Eurozone.
        However, it participates in the Schengen Area and the European Single
        Market through bilateral treaties.

        Switzerland occupies the crossroads of Germanic and Romance Europe, as
        reflected in its four main linguistic and cultural regions: German,
        French, Italian and Romansh. Although the majority of the population are
        German-speaking, Swiss national identity is rooted in a common
        historical background, shared values such as federalism and direct
        democracy,[16] as well as Alpine symbolism.[17][18] Due to its
        linguistic diversity, Switzerland is known by a variety of native names:
        Schweiz [ˈʃvaɪts] (German);[note 5] Suisse [sɥis(ə)] (French); Svizzera
        [ˈzvittsera] (Italian); and Svizra [ˈʒviːtsrɐ, ˈʒviːtsʁɐ]
        (Romansh).[note 6] On coins and stamps, the Latin name, Confoederatio
        Helvetica – frequently shortened to "Helvetia" – is used instead of the
        four national languages. A developed country, it has the highest nominal
        wealth per adult[19] and the eighth-highest per capita gross domestic
        product; it has been considered a tax haven.[20][21] It ranks highly on
        some international metrics, including economic competitiveness and human
        development. Its cities such as Zürich, Geneva and Basel rank among the
        highest in the world in terms of quality of life,[22][23] albeit with
        some of the highest costs of living in the world.[24] In 2020, IMD
        placed Switzerland first in attracting skilled workers.[25] The WEF
        ranks it the fifth most competitive country globally.
