      <h1>China</h1>
      <p>
        China (Chinese: 中国; pinyin: Zhōngguó; lit. 'Central State; Middle
        Kingdom'), officially the People's Republic of China (Chinese:
        中华人民共和国; pinyin: Zhōnghuá Rénmín Gònghéguó; abbr. PRC), is a
        country in East Asia. It is the world's most populous country, with a
        population of more than 1.4 billion. China follows a single standard
        time offset of UTC+08:00 even though it spans five geographical time
        zones and borders 14 countries, the second most of any country in the
        world after Russia. Covering an area of approximately 9.6 million square
        kilometers (3.7 million mi2), it is the world's third or fourth largest
        country.[j] The country is officially divided into 23 provinces,[k] five
        autonomous regions, and four direct-controlled municipalities of Beijing
        (capital city), Tianjin, Shanghai (largest city), and Chongqing, as well
        as two special administrative regions, Hong Kong and Macau.

        China emerged as one of the world's first civilizations, in the fertile
        basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain. China was one of the
        world's foremost economic powers for most of the two millennia from the
        1st until the 19th century. For millennia, China's political system was
        based on absolute hereditary monarchies, or dynasties, beginning with
        the Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE. Since then, China has expanded,
        fractured, and re-unified numerous times. In the 3rd century BCE, the
        Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire. The
        succeeding Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE) saw some of the most advanced
        technology at that time, including papermaking and the compass, along
        with agricultural and medical improvements. The invention of gunpowder
        and movable type in the Tang dynasty (618–907) and Northern Song Dynasty
        (960–1127) completed the Four Great Inventions. Tang culture spread
        widely in Asia, as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as
        Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa. The Qing Empire, China's last
        dynasty, which formed the territorial basis for modern China, suffered
        heavy losses to foreign imperialism. The Chinese monarchy collapsed in
        1912 with the 1911 Revolution, when the Republic of China (ROC) replaced
        the Qing dynasty. China was invaded by the Empire of Japan during World
        War II. The Chinese Civil War resulted in a division of territory in
        1949 when the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) led by Mao Zedong
        established the People's Republic of China on mainland China while the
        Kuomintang-led ROC government retreated to the island of Taiwan.[l] Both
        the PRC and the ROC currently claim to be the sole legitimate government
        of China, resulting in an ongoing dispute even after the United Nations
        recognized the PRC as the government to represent China at all UN
        conferences in 1971. China is currently governed as a unitary one-party
        socialist republic by the Chinese Communist Party.

        China is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and a
        founding member of several multilateral and regional cooperation
        organizations such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Silk
        Road Fund, the New Development Bank, the Shanghai Cooperation
        Organization, and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, and
        is a member of the BRICS, the G8+5, the G20, the APEC, and the East Asia
        Summit. It ranks among the lowest in international measurements of civil
        liberties, government transparency, freedom of the press, freedom of
        religion and ethnic minorities. Chinese authorities have been criticized
        by political dissidents and human rights activists for widespread human
        rights abuses, including political repression, mass censorship, mass
        surveillance of their citizens and violent suppression of protests.

        After economic reforms in 1978, and its entry into the World Trade
        Organization in 2001, China's economy became the second-largest country
        by nominal GDP in 2010 and grew to the largest in the world by PPP in
        2014. China is the world's fastest-growing major economy, the
        second-wealthiest nation in the world, and the world's largest
        manufacturer and exporter. The nation has the world's largest standing
        army—the People's Liberation Army—the second-largest defense budget, and
        is a recognized nuclear weapons state. China has been characterized as a
        potential superpower due to its large economy and powerful military.
