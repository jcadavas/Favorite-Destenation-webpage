      <h1>Japan</h1>

      <p>
        Japan (Japanese: 日本, Nippon or Nihon,[nb 1] and formally 日本国[nb 2])
        is an island country in East Asia, located in the northwest Pacific
        Ocean. It is bordered on the west by the Sea of Japan, and extends from
        the Sea of Okhotsk in the north toward the East China Sea and Taiwan in
        the south. Part of the Ring of Fire, Japan spans an archipelago of 6852
        islands covering 377,975 square kilometers (145,937 sq mi); the five
        main islands are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, and Okinawa. Tokyo
        is Japan's capital and largest city; other major cities include
        Yokohama, Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, Fukuoka, Kobe, and Kyoto.
      </p>
      <p>
        Japan is the eleventh-most populous country in the world, as well as one
        of the most densely populated and urbanized. About three-fourths of the
        country's terrain is mountainous, concentrating its population of 125.36
        million on narrow coastal plains. Japan is divided into 47
        administrative prefectures and eight traditional regions. The Greater
        Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world, with
        more than 37.4 million residents.
      </p>
      <p>
        Japan has been inhabited since the Upper Paleolithic period (30,000 BC),
        though the first written mention of the archipelago appears in a Chinese
        chronicle finished in the 2nd century AD. Between the 4th and 9th
        centuries, the kingdoms of Japan became unified under an emperor and the
        imperial court based in Heian-kyō. Beginning in the 12th century,
        political power was held by a series of military dictators (shōgun) and
        feudal lords (daimyō), and enforced by a class of warrior nobility
        (samurai). After a century-long period of civil war, the country was
        reunified in 1603 under the Tokugawa shogunate, which enacted an
        isolationist foreign policy. In 1854, a United States fleet forced Japan
        to open trade to the West, which led to the end of the shogunate and the
        restoration of imperial power in 1868. In the Meiji period, the Empire
        of Japan adopted a Western-modeled constitution and pursued a program of
        industrialization and modernization. In 1937, Japan invaded China; in
        1941, it entered World War II as an Axis power. After suffering defeat
        in the Pacific War and two atomic bombings, Japan surrendered in 1945
        and came under a seven-year Allied occupation, during which it adopted a
        new constitution. Under the 1947 constitution, Japan has maintained a
        unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy with a bicameral
        legislature, the National Diet.

        Japan is a great power and a member of numerous international
        organizations, including the United Nations (since 1956), the OECD, and
        the Group of Seven. Although it has renounced its right to declare war,
        the country maintains Self-Defense Forces that rank as one of the
        world's strongest militaries. After World War II, Japan experienced
        record growth in an economic miracle, becoming the second-largest
        economy in the world by 1990. As of 2021, the country's economy is the
        third-largest by nominal GDP and the fourth-largest by PPP. A global
        leader in the automotive and electronics industries, Japan has made
        significant contributions to science and technology. Ranked "very high"
        on the Human Development Index, Japan has one of the world's highest
        life expectancies, though it is experiencing a decline in population.
        The culture of Japan is well known around the world, including its art,
        cuisine, music, and popular culture, which encompasses prominent comic,
        animation and video game industries.
