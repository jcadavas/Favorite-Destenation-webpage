      <h1>Budapest</h1>
      <p>
        Budapest (/ˈbuːdəpɛst, -pɛʃt/, Hungarian pronunciation: [ˈbudɒpɛʃt]) is
        the capital and most populous city of Hungary. It is the ninth-largest
        city in the European Union by population within city limits;[10][11][12]
        the city has an estimated population of 1,752,286 over a land area of
        about 525 square kilometres (203 square miles).[13] Budapest, which is
        both a city and county, forms the centre of the Budapest metropolitan
        area, which has an area of 7,626 square kilometres (2,944 square miles)
        and a population of 3,303,786, comprising 33% of the population of
        Hungary
      </p>

        The history of Budapest began when an early Celtic settlement
        transformed into the Roman town of Aquincum,[16][17] the capital of
        Lower Pannonia.[16] The Hungarians arrived in the territory in the late
        9th century,[18] but the area was pillaged by the Mongols in
        1241–42.[19] Re-established Buda became one of the centres of
        Renaissance humanist culture by the 15th century.[20][21][22] The Battle
        of Mohács, in 1526, was followed by nearly 150 years of Ottoman
        rule.[23] After the reconquest of Buda in 1686, the region entered a new
        age of prosperity, with Pest-Buda becoming a global city after the
        unification of Buda, Óbuda and Pest on 17 November 1873, with the name
        'Budapest' given to the new capital.[13][24] Budapest also became the
        co-capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire,[25] a great power that
        dissolved in 1918, following World War I. The city was the focal point
        of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, the Battle of Budapest in 1945, as
        well as the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.
